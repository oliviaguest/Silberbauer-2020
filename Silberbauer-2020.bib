	abstract = {The proportions of ions in rivers of South Africa and Lesotho were investigated using Maucha diagrams, which allow a visual assessment of the ionic proportions of any water sample. Four broad categories of ionic proportions show clear geographical distribution patterns linked to the geological and climatological character of the country. Category 1 (dominant ions Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3-; Na+ {\textless} 25\% of cations) is restricted to the regions of the high altitude basalt cap of Lesotho/KwaZulu-Natal and the Dolomite and Pretoria Series of the Northern Transvaal. Category 2 (dominant ions Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3-; Na+ {\textgreater}25\% of cations) mostly encircles category 1 at lower altitudes; it occurs on Karoo and Waterberg sedimentary rocks arid igneous rocks of the Basement Complex and the Bushveld Igneous Complex. Category 3 (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-, Cl- more or less co-dominant) is widespread and not apparently associated with any particular geological formations. Category 4 (Na+ and Cl- dominant) occurs in the south-western Cape on Table Mountain Sandstones, in the western arid regions on Karoo sediments, and in coastal KwaZulu-Natal on a variety of substrata. Waters in categories 1 and 2 are 'rock dominated'; dilute waters in category 4 are 'precipitation (rainfall) dominated' and concentrated waters in category 4 are 'evaporation-precipitation (crystallization) dominated'. It is shown that dilute rainfall-dominated waters can become directly evaporation-dominated in more arid areas. The significance of ions in the distribution of aquatic biota is unclear.},

	title = {Trajectories of change in wetlands of the {Fynbos} {Biome} from the late 1980s to 2014},
	abstract = {In this project, a set of 65 wetlands originally sampled during the late 1980s in the Western Cape (Silberbauer and King 1991a \& 1991b) were revisited. For each wetland, a rapid habitat assessment was carried out and the current land-use within and around the wetland examined. Water chemistry was assessed by taking in situ measurements and extracting water samples for laboratory analysis. Biological samples in the form of diatoms, plants and invertebrates were also collected. The results of these assessments were used to derive the overall environmental condition (expressed as the Present Ecological State) and were compared to the likely condition during the time of the original survey. From the above results, the type and extent of threats that wetlands of the Fynbos Biome have been exposed to over the past 25 years were identified. On comparing WQ for each study wetland during the historical project and the present, it was found that in terms of water quality: 3\% of the wetlands have improved; 17\% of the wetlands are the same; 9\% of the wetlands likely to be the same (but data are lacking); 9\% of the wetlands have deteriorated (significantly); 17\% of the wetlands show a slight deterioration; 6\% of the wetlands have possibly deteriorated but data are too limited to be conclusive. The change in WQ for the remaining 39\% could not be determined due to lack of either historical or present day data.},

	abstract = {National and regional water quality monitoring networks have been operated in South Africa since the early 1970s. These originally had text-based inventories that were convenient for specialists who were familiar with the national networks and knew the locations of their sites of interest. However, within two decades the networks had expanded in geographical extent and variables monitored to such an extent that users needed spatial context in order to locate sites that fitted their information requirements. Mapping applications running on the Internet, such as Google Earth and Leaflet, form the foundation of a system for providing online inventories and summaries of the data available on the water quality database. The interfaces were constructed using available software, mainly ArcInfo and R. A recent concern is a decrease in the collection of water quality data, which is reducing the value of data summaries for water resource management.},
